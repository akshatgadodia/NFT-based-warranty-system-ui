        data : `NFTs are tokens that we can use to represent ownership of unique items. They let us tokenise things like art, collectibles, even real estate. They can only have one official owner at a time and they're secured by the Ethereum blockchain – no one can modify the record of ownership or copy/paste a new NFT into existence.
        NFT stands for non-fungible token. Non-fungible is an economic term that you could use to describe things like your furniture, a song file, or your computer. These things are not interchangeable for other items because they have unique properties.`

        data : `It’s important to outline the distinction between cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens. Although both are based on blockchain technology, the fundamental differences can help us to understand how NFTs work. 
        The key difference goes back to cryptocurrency being fungible. You can exchange a Bitcoin for another Bitcoin, for example. However, you cannot do so for an NFT. A non-fungible token is tied to one particular digital asset and cannot be replaced. `

        data : `Your NFT journey wouldn't be complete if you don't take out your time to learn how they work. To make things 
        easier, we’ll be explaining the concept in four bullet points.
        Most NFTs are actually held on the Ethereum blockchain, which is a decentralized public ledger that supports smart contracts. You might want to take some time to research more about this because it will come in handy especially if you intend to mint NFTs.
        NFTs exist as individual tokens that hold useful data.
        Just like any other physical arts or objects, NFTs can be traded. Their price or value is determined by the demand and supply forces of the market.
        NFTs feature a unique verification system, which makes it easier to validate and confirm ownership or transfer of assets`

        title : `Can NFTs be copied?`,
        data : `No, and Yes. While the technology “NFT” cannot be replicated because of security factors inherited from blockchain,
        the media can be copied easily.
        Take, for example, the Mona Lisa painting done by Leonardo da Vinci, while there are many lookalikes and iterations of the 
        original painting, there is no two original Mona Lisa artwork. The same goes for NFT, it’s impossible to fake the creator’s 
        wallet even though copying the contents of an NFT can be done.
        NFTs contain unique codes stored on the blockchain in an immutable form that makes it possible to trace them back to 
        the creator. Read our detailed article here on where NFTs are stored.`

        data : `It’s permanent: Unlike paper-based certificates that deteriorate with time or gets lost when the watch changes hands, NFT tokens are permanently recorded in the Ethereum Blockchain. Over time, the watch manufacturer may cease to exist, but records of the watches that it manufactured live on as NFT Token on the Ethereum Blockchain forever.
        It’s unfakable: A watch buyer simply needs to visit Etherscan to view BreitLex’s Smart Contract, the BreitLex NFT tokens minted, and then cross-reference the watch details on IPFS to be assured that it is authentic.     
        Its history is known: Details about how the watch changed hands are well documented as part of the token’s transaction. Now you know that you are the 4th, 5th, or nth owner!`
